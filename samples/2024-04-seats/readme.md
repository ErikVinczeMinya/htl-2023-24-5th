# Cinema Seat Plan

## Introduction

A friend of yours runs a small city cinema. She asks you to build a simple app with which she can put together seats for incoming parties.

## Starter Code

You find the starter code in [_Seats_](./Seats/). Look through the code. The requirements are in the comments. Look particularly for comments marked with `TODO`.

## Non-Functional Requirements

This example is WPF-only. You do not need to add Entity Framework or any other database. In the last exam, you have already proven that you can work with databases. In this example, we want to focus on WPF completely.
